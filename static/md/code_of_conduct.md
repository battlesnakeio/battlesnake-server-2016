# BattleSnake 2016 Code of Conduct

### Be friendly and patient.

__Be welcoming.__ We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports
people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to
members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour,
immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual
orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status,
political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.

__Be considerate.__ Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn
will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users
and participants, and you should take those consequences into account when
making decisions. Remember we are trying to build a fun competition and that means working and helping individuals from other
countries and cultures.

__Be respectful.__ Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no
excuse for poor behavior and  poor manners. We might all experience some
frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a
personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where
people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Attendees
should be respectful when working with each other and with anyone
outside of our workplace.

__Be careful in the words that you choose.__ We are a community of
students and professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others.
Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other
exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Violent threats or language directed against another person.
* Discriminatory jokes and language.
* Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
* Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
* Unwelcome sexual attention.
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
* Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.

__When we disagree, try to understand why.__ Disagreements, both
social and technical, happen all the time and BattleSnake is no exception. It
is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views
constructively. Remember that we're different. The strength of BattleSnake
comes from our ability to work together to our goals. Different people have
different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone
holds a viewpoint doesn't mean that they're wrong. Don't forget that it is
human to err and blaming each other doesn't get us anywhere. Instead,
focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.
