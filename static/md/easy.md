# Getting Started Guide

This guide will show you how to get a sample snake up and running quickly. This guide uses the
Python snake, but the experience should be similar for other languages.


## What You'll Need

- [Heroku Account](https://heroku.com)
- [Cloud9](https://c9.io)
- [Github](https://github.com)


## Install Python Packages

Install required Python packages by clicking on the terminal and running
 `sudo pip install -r requirements.txt`

**NOTE: This may take a couple minutes to complete**.

## Run the Server

Use your mouse to run main app file `/app/main.py`

![Run the server](/static/img/setup/run.png)

You should now see the server running! Everything your snake outputs will be visible here.

Copy the URL outputted because you'll need it for the next step.


## Create a Game With Your Snake

Now that you have a running snake, you can add it to Battlesnake!
