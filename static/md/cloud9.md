# Getting Started Guide

This guide will show you how to get a sample snake up and running quickly. This guide uses the
Python snake, but the experience should be similar for other languages.


## What You'll Need

- [Cloud9](https://c9.io)
- [Battlesnake Python Sample](https://github.com/sendwithus/battlesnake-python)


## Create an App on Cloud9

Now, lets clone the Github Python sample into Cloud9.

- make sure your app is public so the Battlesnake servers can access it publicly
- copy the sample Github url into the form `https://github.com/sendwithus/battlesnake-python`
- select Python as your language

## Install Python Packages

Install required Python packages by clicking on the terminal and running
`sudo pip install -r requirements.txt`

**NOTE: This may take a couple minutes**.

## Run the Server

Use your mouse to run main app file `/app/main.py`

![Run the server](/static/img/cloud9/run.png)

You should now see the server running! Everything your snake outputs will be visible here.

## Check that Your Server Is Running

Now, make sure your server is running by visiting it's URL in your browser.
