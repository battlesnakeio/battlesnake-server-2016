## Coming Prepared


__Your team will be writing code.__ You should come prepared with the following:

* Laptop with a functioning development environment, including:
    * Git Command Line
    * Heroku Command Line
    * Programming language of choice (we suggest Python, NodeJS, or Ruby)
    * Text Editor (Sublime Text, Atom, Vim, etc)
* GitHub Account (free)
* Heroku Account (free)

### Learning Heroku

We __strongly__ recommend familiarizing yourself with Heroku before the event. Using Heroku to power your Snake AI is not required but is __highly recommended__ in order to maximize time spent developing your Snake AI (and not messing around with servers).

All provided code samples and example AIs will be deployable to Heroku as is.

Suggested Readings:

* Getting Started on Heroku
* Heroku Toolbelt
* Deploying to Heroku with Git
* Deploying to Heroku with Dropbox

### Team Registration

BattleSnake is a team competition and we recommended teams of 2-4. You are welcome to register and compete as an individual although we don't recommend it.

Team registration will open at 11:00 am.

To register, you'll need a team name and the email address of all team members.
