## Testing Your Snake AI

There are two easy ways to test your snake.

### Automated Snake Test

To make sure your snake server is working correctly, you can run a quick test by visiting [www.battlesnake.io/test](/test) while logged in to your team's account.

The test page will create a fake game and send fake game commands to your snake, displaying the responses back to you. Use this page to verify that your snake server is running properly and responding in a manner the BattleSnake game servers can understand.

Once your snake is responding correctly to all commands, you're ready to start programming your AI.

### Running Exhibition Games

Throughout the day you can create and run your own games against whichever snakes you want. To create a game, visit [create new game](/app/game/new) page.

You can select which snakes to include in the game (up to 12), what size game board to play, and what game mode to use (Classic or Advanced). You may only create games between your snake, bounty snakes, test snakes, and other teams who have made their snake public.

If you wish to create practice games between your snake and other BattleSnake teams, all teams will need to make their snakes public first. You can change this setting on your [team settings page](/team).
