## Getting Started

Teams will be programming and deploying a web server that implements the [BattleSnake HTTP API](#9-api). Your snake will be represented by a URL that points to your server.

Before, during and after each game, the BattleSnake game servers will communicate with each participating snake using HTTP requests. How your server responds to these requests will determine how your snake plays the game.

We strongly recommend that teams [use Heroku to deploy their snake](#preparing) to a public URL (such as [battlesnake.herokuapp.com](http://battlesnake.herokuapp.com)).

To help teams get started quickly we've provided starter snakes for some common web languages. These starter snakes come preconfigured to deploy to Heroku; we suggesting forking them to start building your own snake.
