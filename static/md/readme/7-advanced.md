## Advanced Game Rules

Advanced games include all the rules and gameplay mechanics of Classic mode games (see above), with the addition of two new mechanics...

### Extra Walls

Additional walls will spawn on the game board. Snakes will die if they collide with walls.

Each wall will permanently occupy a 1x1 area on the game board. Walls will not spawn immediately in front of your snake, and will generally prefer open areas.

Wall positions will be available in the API during Advanced games.

### Gold Coins

Gold coins will spawn on the game board. The first snake to collect 5 gold coins will immediately win the game.

Snakes can collect a gold coin by colliding with it. Coins will prefer to spawn near the middle of the board, and there will be never be more than one coin on the board at any given time.

The position of any gold coins will be available in the API during Advanced games.
