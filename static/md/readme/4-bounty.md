## Bounty Snakes

BattleSnake sponsors wanted to get more involved this year, so we've introduced Bounty Snakes.

Bounty Snakes are snakes programmed by sponsors in advance of the tournament. Each Bounty Snake will have a bounty prize attached to it, along with specific criteria for defeating it. The first team to successfully defeat a Bounty Snake throughout the day will claim its bounty prize.

Bounty Snakes will not go down easy, and we suggest not spending time focused on defeating Bounty Snakes.

Available Bounty Snakes and their rewards will are listed under [Prizes and Awards](#4-prizes). Some Bounty Snakes may not appear until the day of the event.

#### Claiming a Bounty Prize

If your team feels they have successfully defeated a Bounty Snake, immediately record the name of the game and inform a BattleSnake volunteer or the registration desk of your glorious achievement.

The first team to claim verifiable victory over a Bounty Snake will receive its prize. Teams can defeat at most one Bounty Snake during the event.
