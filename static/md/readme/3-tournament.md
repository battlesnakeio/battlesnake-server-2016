## Tournament

This year's tournament will be split into two brackets: one for beginner competitors and another for advanced teams.

The _Beginner Bracket_ will feature basic gameplay mechanics and is ideal for first time attendees and/or novice programmers.

The _Advanced Bracket_ will introduce new challenging gameplay mechanics and even greater prizes, ideal for BattleSnake veterans and teams wanting to compete against the best.

Teams may decide which bracket they wish to enter during registration.

#### Tournament Format

Each tournament will consist of groups of 4-8 snakes. Snakes in the same group will compete at the same time in a best of 3, and the winning snakes will move on to the next round. Groups are assigned at random, and will be announced around 5pm.

The tournament itself will start at 6pm, and all tournament games will be live casted on stage in ECS 123. Cheering and friendly shouting are strongly encouraged. Bring your friends!
