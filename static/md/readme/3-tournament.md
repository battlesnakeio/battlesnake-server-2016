## Tournament

This year's tournament will be split into two brackets: Classic and Advanced.

The _Classic Bracket_ will feature familiar snake gameplay mechanics and is ideal for first time attendees and/or novice programmers.

The _Advanced Bracket_ will introduce new challenging gameplay mechanics and even greater prizes, ideal for BattleSnake veterans and teams wanting to compete against the best.

Teams may decide which bracket they wish to enter during registration.

#### Tournament Format

Each tournament will consist of a group stage, semi-finals, and finals. Groups will be assigned randomly and the winning snake (or snakes) will move on to the next round.

Tournament format and group assignments will be announced at 5pm. The tournament itself will start at 6pm. All tournament games will be live casted on stage in ECS 123. Cheering and friendly shouting are strongly encouraged. Bring your friends!
