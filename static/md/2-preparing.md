## Coming Prepared


__Your team will be writing code.__ You should come prepared with the following:

* Laptop with a functioning development environment, including:
    * Git Command Line
    * Heroku Command Line
    * Programming language of choice (we suggest Python, NodeJS, or Ruby)
    * Text Editor (Sublime Text, Atom, Vim, etc)
* GitHub Account (free)
* Heroku Account (free)

### Learning Heroku

We __strongly__ recommend familiarizing yourself with Heroku before the event. Using Heroku to power your Snake AI is not required but is __highly recommended__ in order to maximize time spent developing your Snake AI (and not messing around with servers).

All provided code samples and example AIs will be deployable to Heroku as is.

Suggested Readings:

* Getting Started on Heroku
* Heroku Toolbelt
* Deploying to Heroku with Git
* Deploying to Heroku with Dropbox

### Team Registration

BattleSnake is a team competition and we recommended teams of 2-4. You are welcome to register and compete as an individual although we don't recommend it.

Team registration will open at 11:00 am.

To register, you'll need a team name and the email address of all team members.

### Tournament Brackets

This year's competition will be split into two brackets: one for beginner competitors and another for advanced teams.

The _Beginner Bracket_ will feature basic gameplay mechanics and is ideal for first time attendees and/or novice programmers.

The _Advanced Bracket_ will introduce new challenging gameplay mechanics and even greater prizes, ideal for BattleSnake veterans and teams wanting to compete against the best.

Teams may decide which bracket they wish to enter during registration.
